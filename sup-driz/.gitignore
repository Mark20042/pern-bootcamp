# Drizzle Metadata (Optional but recommended)
# You usually keep the SQL files, but sometimes ignore the meta folder
# However, for Drizzle Kit to work well on other machines, it is often best to keep the whole drizzle folder.
# If you want to be safe, just ignore OS files:
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
